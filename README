This is the README file for my little Coap project.

Coap is going to be an IPC library.

For the most part IPC is kind of crappy.  I plan to use the COAP
protocol to implement the backbone of an IPC library for my Linted
project.  Goals are to use DHCP and DNS to dynamically register
localhost IP addresses such as 127.1.12.42 under DNS names such as
myservice.localhost and then communicate between these services.
